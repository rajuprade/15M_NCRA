<DD>
<DL >This command performs <A HREF="node32.html#sectsearchingfordocuments">keyword
      searching</A> of locally available (or
      locally catalogued) <A HREF="node4.html#secthypertextdocuments">documents</A>
      and displays a list of those found using a <A HREF="node50.html#sectusingwwwbrowsers">WWW
      browser</A>. This list includes hyper-links
      to the parts of each document that were matched.
<P>

<P>
 </DL>
   <DT>
      Parameters
   
<DD>
<DL ><DT>
         keyword
      
<DD>
         The string of characters to be searched for. This is treated as a
         single string (not as multiple keywords) and should be quoted if it
         contains special characters or white space. Pattern matching
         characters, as used in <tt>&quot;</tt>sed<tt>&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;</tt>grep<tt>&quot;</tt> regular expressions, may be
         included.
<P>
         If this parameter is omitted, then all documents searched will be
         matched. This provides a convenient way of listing all the
         documents available.
      
      <DT>
         doclist
      
<DD>
         An optional space-separated list of the documents to be
         searched. If this is omitted, then the complete set of
         hypertext documents will be searched, as found on the
         <A HREF="node10.html#sectsearchpath"><tt>HTX_PATH</tt> search path.</A> Any further documents
         described in <A HREF="node41.html#sectcataloguefiles">catalogue
         files</A>
         will also be included.
<P>
         Any <tt>&quot;</tt>.htx<tt>&quot;</tt> extension on document names is ignored.
      
<P>
 </DL>
   <DT>
      Switches
   
<DD>
<DL ><DT>
         -b
      
<DD>
         Requests that a <tt>&quot;</tt>brief<tt>&quot;</tt> list be produced of the documents found. This
         means that only document names and titles will appear and references
         to individual pages will be omitted. By default, individual pages will
         be listed if the search has included them and they match the search
         criteria.
      
      <DT>
         -c
      
<DD>
         Indicates that case is significant when searching for the keyword. By
         default, differences in case are ignored.
      
      <DT>
         -f
      
<DD>
         Indicates that a full search should be performed, involving searching
         document names, titles, page headings and lines of text. This option
         is shorthand for the switches <tt>-n</tt>, <tt>-t</tt>, <tt>-h</tt> and <tt>-l</tt> used together.
      
      <DT>
         -h
      
<DD>
         Indicates that a search for the keyword is to be performed on
         all the <A HREF="node34.html#sectsearchheading">page
         headings</A> within each document.This provides a convenient
         compromise between speed of execution and full search
         coverage, and generally produces an acceptable amount of
         output. By default, a search on page headings is performed if
         the keyword cannot be found in any document title. Page
         headings may only be searched in local hypertext (<tt>&quot;</tt>.htx<tt>&quot;</tt>)
         documents.
      
      <DT>
         -html
      
<DD>
         Indicates that the list of documents found by this command should not
         be displayed using a WWW browser. Instead, the results are simply
         written to standard output as a list in <A NAME=tex2html49 HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html ">HTML</A> format (without
         a surrounding HTML document). This
         provides an interface for other software that will display
         the results itself.
<P>
         Note that the <A NAME=tex2html50 HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/URL/Overview.html ">URLs</A> used for hyper-links in this output list
         will be suitable only for local use by a WWW browser running on the
         same machine as the <tt>findme</tt> command. They may not be suitable,
         for instance, for embedding in an HTML document that will be
         interpreted by a remote WWW browser.
      
      <DT>
         -l
      
<DD>
         Indicates that a search for the keyword is to be performed on
         all <A HREF="node34.html#sectsearchline">lines of text</A>
          within each
document (note that this will include all HTML tags, URLs,
<em>etc.</em>). This provides the fullest possible form of keyword search,
but may take some time to complete and could generate a large volume
of output. By default, a search of document lines is only performed if
the keyword cannot be found in any document title or page
heading. Line-oriented searching can only be performed on local
hypertext (<tt>&quot;</tt>.htx<tt>&quot;</tt>) documents.
      
      <DT>
         -m
      
<DD>
         Indicates that the output list is to contain information on which
         search criteria were matched and how many matches were found. By
         default, this information is omitted.
      
      <DT>
         -n
      
<DD>
         Indicates that a search for the keyword is to be performed on
         the <A HREF="node34.html#sectsearchname">name</A>
 of each document.
         Searching of document names is not performed by default.
      
      <DT>
         -q
      
<DD>
         Indicates that the search should progress in <tt>&quot;</tt>quiet<tt>&quot;</tt> mode without
         producing messages about its progress. By default, messages about the
         progress of the search are written to the controlling terminal.
      
      <DT>
         -s
      
<DD>
         Indicates that the output list is to be sorted so that the most
         significant matches appear first and the least significant last.
         In assessing this, matches to the document name are given the highest
         significance, then matches to titles, page headings and finally lines
         of textual content (see &#167;<A HREF="node34.html#sectdepthofsearch"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="./cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>). An alphabetical sort on document title and page
         heading is used to resolve any remaining ambiguity over output order.
         By default, a simple alphabetical sort on document title and page
         heading is used alone.
      
      <DT>
         -t
      
<DD>
         Indicates that a search for the keyword is to be performed on
         the <A HREF="node34.html#sectsearchtitle">title</A>  of each document.
         This provides a quick but effective form of search for major
         topics and gives at most one entry in the output list for
         each document matched. By default, title matching is
         performed first, and a search of page headings (and
         eventually lines of textual content) is performed only if
         this initial search fails to match any documents (see
         &#167;<A HREF="node34.html#sectdepthofsearch"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="./cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>). Using <tt>-t</tt> prevents these
         subsequent searches from happening automatically.
      
      <DT>
         -w
      
<DD>
         Indicates that the keyword supplied must match an entire word
         (<em>i.e.</em> a
         string delimited by characters which are not underscores or
         alphanumerics, or delimited by the beginning or end of the text, or
         by a newline). By default, the specified string of characters is
         matched wherever it occurs, so long as it does not span multiple
         lines of text.
      
      <DT>
         -warn
      
<DD>
         Indicates that any warning messages issued by the WWW browser
         (<em>e.g.</em> when it is started up) are to be suppressed. By default, these
         warnings are written to standard error along with any other warning
         or error messages.
      
<P>
 </DL>
   <DT>
      Exit Status
   
<DD>
<DL >The exit status from this command is set equal to the number of
      documents matched by the search. Thus a non-zero exit status
      indicates success, while a zero status indicates failure to find
      any document. Note that this is the reverse of the convention
      normally adopted by UNIX commands.

      Notes On Searching
   
<DD>
<DL ><UL><LI> 
         If none of the switches <tt>-n</tt>, <tt>-t</tt>, <tt>-h</tt> or <tt>-l</tt> is used, the keyword
         given will first be searched for in the title of each document. If this
         fails to produce a match, it will next be searched for in the page
         headings of each document. If this also fails to produce a match, a final
         search of the lines of text within each document will be made.
<P>
         <LI> 
         If one or more of the switches <tt>-n</tt>, <tt>-t</tt>, <tt>-h</tt> or <tt>-l</tt> is used, the
         automatic sequence of searches described above will not occur. Instead,
         only those document components specified by these switches (name, title,
         page header and lines of text, respectively) will be searched. This will
         be done in a single pass through all documents.
<P>
         <LI> 
         To obtain the fullest possible (but slowest) search, use the <tt>-f</tt>
         option. This is equivalent to using all of the switches
         <tt>-n</tt>, <tt>-t</tt>, <tt>-h</tt> and <tt>-l</tt> together.
<P>
</UL> 
 </DL>
   <DT>
      Notes on Specifying Documents
   
<DD>
<DL ><UL><LI> 
         If no documents are specified, then all directories on the
         <tt>HTX_PATH</tt> search path will be inspected for hypertext
         (<tt>&quot;</tt>.htx<tt>&quot;</tt>) documents and all those found will be searched.
         In addition, if any directory on the search path contains a
         catalogue file, the documents it describes will also be
         included in any search of document names or titles (but not
         of page headings or lines of text).
<P>
         <LI> 
         If one or more document names are supplied, then the search will be
         restricted to the specified documents only.
         If these document names are supplied without directory information, then
         they will be located by following the <tt>HTX_PATH</tt> search path
         and then by reading the contents of any catalogue files, if necessary.
         If document names are supplied with explicit directory information,
         then they must refer to local hypertext documents and no
         search will be made to locate them.
<P>
         <LI> 
         If documents with the same name are found both locally in hypertext
         form and in one or more catalogue files, then the hypertext version takes
         precedence.
         If a document with the same name appears more than once in the list
         given for the <tt>doclist</tt> parameter, then the first occurrence takes
         precedence, except that the first occurrence of a name with explicit
         directory information always takes precedence over the same document
         specified without directory information.

         the document called <tt>&quot;</tt>pkg_manual<tt>&quot;</tt> for the command stored
         in the <tt>keyword</tt> variable
         and appends the resulting list (in HTML format) to a scratch file in
