#  Name:
#     makefile
#
#  Version:
#     Application makefile Mk V
#
#  Purpose:
#     Build and install the HTX package.
#
#  Type of Module:
#     Description file for the make utility.
#
#  Description:
#     This description file is used by the make utility to build the
#     HTX package from the distributed source files, to install
#     the resulting system for use, and to perform other housekeeping
#     tasks.
#
#  Invocation:
#     This makefile is not intended to be used by make when invoked
#     directly (although this is possible), but instead to be used via
#     the accompanying mk script.  This script sets up a number of
#     environment variables which are used as macros within the
#     makefile and which accommodate differences between machines and
#     operating systems (it invokes make with the -e option).  Please
#     consult the mk script prologue for full details.
#
#  Targets:
#     The following make targets are defined in this script for
#     external use:
#
#        [help]
#           This is the default target.  It outputs a message describing
#           the mk script and lists the targets provided.
#
#        check
#           Performs a simple check that all necessary source files are
#           present, and displays the version number and current state
#           of the package (built/installed/tested, etc.).
#
#        build
#           Compiles the source files and creates all files needed
#           prior to installing the package for use.
#
#        install
#           Installs the package for use by putting the necessary files
#           into sub-directories of the $INSTALL directory (the $HOME
#           directory is used if the environment variable INSTALL is
#           not defined).  Links to the installed files are left in/home/adam2/ser//htx.tar.Z the
#           source directory.
#
#        deinstall
#           Reverses the action of the install target, removing files
#           from sub-directories of the $INSTALL directory and
#           restoring them to the source directory (the $HOME directory
#           is used by default if the environment variable INSTALL is
#           not defined).
#
#        test
#           Builds and runs a simple test program to check for correct
#           installation of the package.
#
#        export
#           Produces an export copy of the built package suitable for
#           passing to another user.  A compressed tar file is created
#           in the $EXPORT directory containing copies of the source
#           files and built files for the package (the current
#           directory is used by default if the environment variable
#           EXPORT is not defined).  The package should normally be
#           built, installed and tested (see above) before using this
#           target.  After unpacking the exported file on a similar
#           machine, the recipient may simply install it for use.
#
#        export_run
#           Produces an export copy of the built package suitable for
#           passing to another user.  A compressed tar file is created
#           in the $EXPORT directory containing copies of the built 
#           files for the package (the current directory is used by 
#           default if the environment variable EXPORT is not defined).
#           The package should normally be built, installed and tested 
#           (see above) before using this target.  After unpacking the
#           exported file on a similar machine, the recipient may simply
#           install it for use.
#
#        export_source
#           Produces an export copy of the source for the package
#           suitable for passing to another user to build (possibly on
#           a different type of machine).  A compressed tar file is
#           created in the $EXPORT directory containing copies of just
#           the source files for the package (the current directory is
#           used by default if the environment variable EXPORT is not
#           defined).  After unpacking the exported file, the recipient
#           must build the package before installing it for use.
#
#        clean
#           Cleans up after building the package, removing all
#           intermediate files created during the building process, but
#           leaving the built files themselves.
#
#        unbuild
#           Reverses the building process, removing all intermediate
#           files along with all the built files.
#
#  External Dependencies:
#     The HTX package does not depend on other Starlink software. It uses
#     only standard UNIX utilities.
#
#  Notes:
#     This makefile uses the presence/absence of the hidden files
#     .BUILT, .INSTALLED_$(SYSTEM) and .TESTED_$(SYSTEM) to record the
#     current state of the system during housekeeping operations.

#
#  History:
#     4-JAN-1993 (RFWS):
#        Original version.
#     15-MAR-1993 (RFWS):
#        Adapted for use on sun4_Solaris.
#     11-JUN-1993 (PMA):
#        Added parts for handling platform specific files.
#     27-SEP-1993 (PMA):
#        Added the target "filler1" to prevent the list of platform
#        specific files being empty, thereby causing a make syntax error.
#     3-NOV-1993 (PMA):
#        Change the check target to print out for which system the
#        software has been built.
#     3-NOV-1993 (PMA):
#        Add a test to check that files really are extracted from the
#        tar file.
#     18-NOV-1993 (PTW):
#        Cosmetics.
#     26-NOV-1993 (PMA):
#        Remove the dummy file "filler1" and add a dummy target called
#        dummy_target1.
#        Add a file called " " to all of the for loops that install and
#        deinstall files to prevent syntax errors if any of the relevent
#        macros are null.
#        Add a macro STARTUP_SCRIPT that is the name of the startup
#        script.
#     4-JAN-1994 (PMA):
#        Add some missing semicolons to for loops. This seems not to
#        cause errors on our systems, but it is a syntax error.
#     7-FEB-1994 (PMA):
#        Move the block data files to the beginning of the definition of
#        OBJECT_FILES. This makes it possible to extract the block data
#        modules with the -u loader flag. This is needed when using f2c.
#     8-AUG-1994 (BLY):
#        Add dependency on source archive to extraction targets.
#     30-NOV-1994 (AJC):
#        Add facility error files
#        Add export_run target
#        Add where installed
#        Prevent installation if not built for this SYSTEM
#        Ensure deinstall is from where it is installed
#        Revise use of package name variables, adding PACK_NAME for
#         use in messages and PKG_LINK for use in INCLUDE FILE links.
#         Use variables in all references.
#        Use installed $(PKG_NAME)_dev to handle INCLUDE files for test
#     24-APR-1995 (AJC):
#        -p on install mkdir
#        Add else clause to catch failue of "elif $(MAKE)"
#        Add exit 1 to detected illegal install and deinstall cases.
#        Remove dependency of files on source archive.
#     2-MAY-1995 (BLY):
#        Shared libraries now in INSTALL_SHARE, also chmod 755.
#        INSTALL_SHARE added to INSTALL_DIRS.
#        RANLIB default changed to : (colon).
#        BLD_SHR default changed to : (colon).
#     5-JUN-1995 (RFWS):
#        Added -f flag to rm commands in clean and unbuild targets.
#     15-JUN-1995 (AJC):
#        Revised check target to cope with export_run versions.
#     16-JUN-1995 (BLY):
#        Designated Mk IVb.
#     26-JUN-1995 (BLY):
#        Modified export, export_run and export_source targets.
#        Cosmetics.
#        Designated Mk IVc.
#     29-JUN-1995 (BLY):
#        Added sections for manipulating Latex and Hypertest documentation.
#        Revised install and deinstall sequences.
#        Changed export* targets to make compressed tar files in one step.
#        Replacing of `rm' with `rm -f' in most cases.
#        Designated Mk V.
#     03-JUL-1995 (BLY):
#        Template makefile now generated automatically.
#     17-JUL-1995 (AJC):
#        Modified hypertext installation/deinstallation to avoid linking
#        if no hypertext documents defined.
#     12-DEC-1996 (BLY):
#        Various minor modifications.
#     13-DEC-1996 (BLY):
#        Version for HTX.
