structure based commn between wrapper and device
  aug 12, 2011

SEP-26-2011------>
We had been facing some problem realted to too many open files.
We thought that it may be because of various files operation like
command.xml,RESPONSE.xml.So we switched over to memory buffer operation.

======================================================================

SEP-27-2011 

Today after running CMS-Wrapper-device for full night.
1. We were getting cannot connect to CMS error.

As we were not closing socket file descriptor.so in sendCMSPkt() we closed the socket fd.

2. We also solved the problem of 1st init command.

In the recv() fucntion of servCMS.c, we enable MSG_DONOTWAIT flag.After that first init command got properly parsed.

====================================================================================
Oct 15 Segmentaion problem due to memory allocation to final_xml pointer.
 made static buffer.
 formRespXml return checked for Null responses; response pointer freed
 at each step
==========================================================================

OCt 17, 2011 ::: sockfile descriptor was not getting closed even after closing the socket.
  used shutdown() and then closed()
Now seems to be working
===============================================================================

Oct 19 2011

---while running batch file, init command was failing after some 3-4 hours, domon command was working fine.
---After going thru the logs,we found that it may be because of malloc used to allocate thread memory for service thread.

---> Now we have used realloc for service thread..and started the test.

========================================================================================

OCT 20 2011

---> Problem wasn't solved by the use of realloc.
     pthread_detach was used in service() in servCMS.C to reclaim the resources.

---> In ConsumCMS.c code is now divided into threadterminate() and checkevent()

=============================================================================

OCT 21 22 23 2011

1. We started the batch file for Sentinal system on Friday ( 21.10.2011) at around 10 AM.

2.  All communication were going fine upto Saturday (22.10.11) at around  3.38 AM.

3. After that time CMS stopped sending init command, It is observed in the log that after 3.38 AM, Wrapper had not received Init command from CMS.

4. Also Wrapper wasn't able to connect to CMS Monitoring_port (19999) from  5:50:14 AM on 22.10.2011 onwards.

5. Communication between Device Client ( Rabbit running sentinel device program ) and Wrapper is still going on.

6. All threads of InvokeWrapper are still alive.

    [teleset@telab2 Desktop]$ ps -aL | grep invoke
  945   945 pts/5    00:00:00 invokeWrapper
  945   946 pts/5    00:00:03 invokeWrapper
  945   947 pts/5    00:01:52 invokeWrapper

7.  Wrapper program running machine's virtual memory count initially showed 38820, now it's showing 40072.

8. File descriptor remains constant through out the execution of Wrapper program.

    ##### Log showing info abt File descriptor

================================================================================


30-NOV-2011

1. We tested the basic SIGCON system with rabbit client.

2. I changed the sigcon_commands.xml and sigcon_engineering.xml file to the need for sigcon system.

3. Wrote the devSigcon.c file in Wrapper program

4. Basic commands from CMS expert tab works well for SIGCOn system, we have tested lo command we were getting success as final response.

5. For the time being I have kept the name of commands as lo,attn,reflo,init,reset,domon.

6. Those names can be changed to SET LO etc.

7. Tommorow will try to implement all other commands in Rabbit program.All commands have been included in Wrapper and CMS.

8. For monitoring point will have to discuss with Mr.Navnath Shinde.

===============================================================================================

1-DEC-2011

1. All commands are included in CMS as well in Wrapper and DeviceClient for SIGCON system

2. Now commands are SET LO ,SET ATTN ,SET REFLO,DOMON.

3. checked all commands with deviceClient, We got response for all commands.

4. Response to Domon command is just timestamp and status which was displaying on SIGCON_engineering GUI.

===========================================================================================================
2-DEC-2011

1. Tested the SIGCON and FRONTEND  system simultaneously.

2. Some error was there in the init_on_powerfail.txt script file, after fixing that error.CMS was sending INIT and Domon commands properly.

3. After reducing the refresh rate in cms.properties to 1 sec,We were able to get current Timestamp on GUI.

4. Sentinel system is currently disconnected from CMS system.
===================================================================
5 DEC 2011 Need Following changes :

a. instead of status variable state or STATE  variable (deviceClient.c)
b. MON is just sending to 19999 port and not 5000 port.
c. in servCMS.c status change to 'state'. cmdname is "Monitoring_Data".
=====================================================================//

28 DEC 2011 wrapperCom.h,c 'int chkpollEvent(int *)' functionality made common so that
 deviceClient program running on PC can check the TCP/IP connectivity.
=====================================================================
12 JAN 2012
(1) Event Port made separate by assignging value 5001
    wrapperCom.c changed for EVNT_IP and EVNT_PORT for connectClient function
(2) On RHEL 64 bit system , pack(push,1) and pop() not working, hence long type in basiccmd field
made int // This is temporary for the servo only.
   - long to int conversion in the BasicFields
=====================================================================
30 JAN 2012 
 In order to make large response data packets so that spectral/correlator data can accommodate:
 reqResp.h modified to introduce DATAPKT
 For Plottting the DATA          DPLOT // enum
 xmlResp.c modified to get the value for DATAPKT.
 (??) Is maxDataSize to parse the XML buffer enough 4096?
==============================================================================================
2 FEB 2012
MaxBufSize 409600 // invokeWrapper.h
argName, argData  // xmlParse, xmlResp.c

###################< Wrapper0 End >######################################################

Wrapper1 updated the changes of Wrapper0

Next pending work
(1) Logging of xml logs
(2) Frequent timeouts occurring  problem
(3) Device Specific command implimentation in dev_<subsystem>.c
(4) _ Response specific customizing
(5) After deviceClient reconnect - minor memory leakage happens - debug
