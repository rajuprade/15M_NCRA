(1) Bug Tracking system requirement - checking

(2) State machine changes upon getting correct value.
    Alarm can be alive.

(3) STATE Machine is normal even if System not communicating

# ALARM level
    Level 5 - STATE MAchine will in suspned (Action handler)
    Level 3,4 - Warning 
    Level 1,2 - Info
    Level 0 - meaningless

   CMSSTATE - Level 5 - Exception handler-fail()? ACTION: SUSPEND

# Wrapper STATE -
    Connected
    Notconnected
    DEACTIVE
    ACTIVE

# Subsystem STATE -
  TIMEOUT - Device not COMMUNICATING
  RESET   - It is not applicable mode because initialization failed.
  NOTOK  
      Cases   ------------------------------------> STATE-machine change   
  OK   
# CMS-STATE
    (1) SHUTDOWN - ( ) script, it will first send shutdown to all wrapper
                       Wrapper will send the shutdown status   
                       OK - then go for tomcat/active shutdonw
                       FAIL - Move Suspend state.
    (2) MAINT - expert/admin --- Implemented
        We shutdown/killed the wrapper - DOMON will get timeout
        and Subsystem Notconnected/disconnected and Alarm will be raise.

    (X) Power_On Failure - Normal STATE - implemtned and tested
    (4) Exception - Exception_Handler_Execution ?SUSPEND:PREVIOUS STATE.
    (5) STANDBY STATE _ Send Command -- Ideal state - Not raise in the alarm.
                     
# RULES ENGINE AND SCRIPT NEED TO BE PROPERLY.

(4) TIME- Delay ~10 sec  for DOMON and ALARM

(5) LoginPage :
    Bestviewed in release firefox 3.6 and above, google-chore
    Adobe flashflare must be installed to run the software.

(6) User Management test -
