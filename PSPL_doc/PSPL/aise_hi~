Nadaan bachpan se jawani ka safar kaise taye kiya....
koi hum se puche....

har mod pe zindagi aur bhi beraham hote gayi,
aur hum seena taane khade rahe....

har mod pe hum seena taane khade rahe 
lekin  zindagi thi jo aur bhi beraham hote gayi....

I hate scripted life..this monotonous nature of life....Sometimes i feel like I have lost the zeal of life....


Chhoti-chhoti chhitrayi yaadein
Bichhi hui hain lamhon ki lawn par.
Nange pair unpar chalte-chalte
Itni door chale aaye
Ki ab bhool gaye hain â€“
Joote kahan utaare the.

Aedi komal thi, jab aaye the.
Thodi si naazuk hai abhi bhi.
Aur nazuk hi rahegi
In khatti-meethi yaadon ki shararat
Jab tak inhe gudgudati rahe.

Sach, bhool gaye hain
Ki joote kahan utaare the.
Par lagta hai,
Ab unki zaroorat nahin."


I will always be thankful to you...for being a very  close frnd of mine as well as for so much caring & affection .
sometimes it really hurt how we were used 2 be...and hw we have become now....

Anyways thanks for giving me some wonderful words ( emotional ,sentimental,possesive ,that's life, let it  be, chalta hai,expectation ).
 
Watever U did that day in bus i vl remember  for life time at that particular moment of time...

Hw U had time to go to pune for purchasing gift n cake for shilpa n shelton on their b'day but never had some time left for me on my b'day...

ab sayad jada din nahi hai hamare saath k....so kabhi soch kar bura lagta hai ki ....kal sayad ye din nahi reh.....it's really painfull to see hw our relation has become and I have no place in ur heart.

jaise tum ne kaha tha ki tumahre saath sirf Shilpa aur Shelton hi the.....waise hi keh deti ki U have no place in my heart just go away......to bhi mujhe koi problem nahi hota......

My only aim calling and chatting with U is to use this moment so that u don't have 2 regret in future...but if u r happy without talking 2 me..then it's fine....no porblems.....

I am going on  28 night around 1 AM ( date 29.10.2010 friday)  so that i can catch 6AM flight.And u r going on 4 Nov..I vl be back on 7 Nov...and I think u vl be back on 13 Nov...

so for around 15 days v vl not meet each other.....

U vl always be very close frnd dear......


jab mile the unse ,
un k dil mein hamari ek tasveer bani thi....
aaj  hum us jagah aapni tasveer talash rahe the 
jahan se hamara naam-o-nishaan tak mita chuke the wo.....
