CMS_Code_walkthrough

##############################

1. CMS architecture overview : 

    CMS code distribution 

    - Sleep routine is added as the jar module has to go major changes.
    - Entire sleep routine has been added.
    - state machine monitors( command response AND monitoring data) the data sent by wrapper.
    

2. Module walk through 

   - Five project are required for complete CMS.
   
     * Cms_batch_processor
     * cms_Validator
     * cms_state_machine
     * CMS_core
     * cms_web 

     *** SPRING framework background is needed.
     --- spring basically load all parameters.
     --- castor reads the xml file and convert it into java objects.
     --- susbsystemMarshaller reads ncra-susbsystem.xml to create susbsystem object.  
     --- For each sub-system a susb-system class is created.
          -- commands supported
          -- Response expected.

     --- sub-system loader will load all sub-system.
     --- eng_UI will be separately read by cms-web.
     --- each controller will have handlerequest.
     --- showhome takes us to showhomecontroller.

     --- 
     --- commandlog code get connected to getcommandcontroller.
    *** JDBC connection is used to connect to databse via cms.
    --- For each row of database entry we have ti establish separate connection for each row.
    --- web-service-databse ( service layer is in cms-web)
    --- Major business layer is in cms_core and cms_state-MACHINE 

    --- cms-core is like a distribution centre.
    --- Velocity -> when mail server is configured,it sends email to the user added by ADMIN.
    --- stored procedure.

Data Monitoring for NCRA : 

--- starting point will be cms-web.
--- xsl ---> gives the struture.
--- Tplot ---> hold all prefrence which user has chosen.
--- flex component sends the user alert messages internally calling java objects.

--- in mysql database we have to update every row by single stored procedure but in orcale kind of databse we can update all row in a one go.

--- HyperSQL ---> support multiple row insertion.
   -- Maven--> build project
     logback --> is API for generating log file

----> physhun modeler -> generate xml file for state machine diagram.

---> mvn clean install --> download from online

---> mvn -o clean install -- offline
