           Bhushan, Swati, Shaival, JPK, RU, Naresh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Bug Tracking system requirement - checking

(2) STATE MACHINE Discusssion :
  
  ## ALARM level
      Level 5 : On occurance of Critical alarm, STATE machine will be in suspend mode (If the 
                exception handler failed otherwise it will restore previous state upon successully
                handling of the alarm).
      Level 3,4 - Warning 
      Level 1,2 - Info
      Level 0 - meaningless
   
  ## Wrapper STATE -
      - Connected : 
      - Notconnected : State machien shall reflect the status automatically once the wrapper disconnected.
      - DEACTIVE : In this state CMS shall not send the command to the subsystem-wrapper server.
      - ACTIVE :
   
  ## Subsystem/Device STATE -
      -TIMEOUT - Device not COMMUNICATING, <status>TIMEOUT</status> will send.
      -RESET   - Wrapper Reset after the reconnection by the device, <status>RESET</status> will send.
      -NOTOK   -
             => STATE-machine shall show the above changes   
      -OK      - 
   
  ## CMS-STATE
    (i) SHUTDOWN -(a) Execution script will first send shutdown  all the Wrapper, wrapper will send 
                   the shutdown status   before exiting the process.
                  (b) If the wrapper server shutdown OK - then CMS implements the tomcat/activemq shutdown
                      If FAIL - Move Suspend state.
    (ii) MAINT - expert/admin --- Implemented
        If We shutdown the wrapper or it got killed, DOMON information
        will not get to the CMS hence subsystem status will be 'disconnected'
        and alarm will be raise.
    (X) Power_On Failure - Normal STATE - implemented and tested
    (iv) Exception - Exception_Handler_Execution ?SUSPEND:PREVIOUS STATE.
    (v) STANDBY STATE _ Send Command -- Ideal state - No  raise in the alarm.
                     
    (vi) During the CMS run, if the sub-system/wrapper get disconnected, STATE machine raise the
        alarm. If the exception handler fails the state to be declare is 'SUSPEND'. But once
        the Subsystem recover automatically and get connected with Initialization successfully, 
        the state machine should recover to the NORMAL STATE  whereas alarm history can
        be alive so that expert/engineer can acknowlege it.

(3) Browser updates the alarming and Monitoring information after the average  delay of  ~10 sec.

(4) LoginPage :
    Bestviewed in release firefox 3.6 and above, google-chore
    Adobe flashflare must be installed to run the software.

(5) User Management test -  User management login quries solved by the PSL team,
    and cleared the test feedback items.

(6) Version Management
    Subsystem version Defined in the  /opt/ncra/lib/ncra-subsystemconfig.xml  
    but not appearing the command. Will get in the next release.
    
(7) Source catalog was not getting updated, but after the explaination by the PSL
    team, the source catalog loaded by the expert need to be declare as a 'SYSTEM'
    catalog.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The CMS - next release Demonstration by the PERSISTENT

(1) CMS facilities

 - CMS States in the header section

 - display for the command status on expert tab

 - Object loading 
   Top header shows coordinate calculation
   gets loaded in tracking display as well

 - 2d-plot for the source catalog update continuosly.

(2) Flex changes queries :
 - Flex Structural changes not possible.
 - New field should be replaced by the existing.
 - Navigation js
 - By clicking the right button it will show whether the component is a  FLEX component.
 - CR item - outer or inner track Polar plot

(3) Chart, spectral and pulsar plotting demonstration and discussion.
 - Engineering need of the Plotting the Monitoring parameters as Y Vs X
   discussed (for e.g. encoder Vs motor current).
 - Default scale should get load in the X-Y plot for the chosen monitoring
   parameters.
 - Digital backend plotting requriement and command implementation
   like sendpulsar/spectral/chart plot data along with the specified
   x-y range parameters, sampling interval etc. discused.
